84W DaisyFX is a multi effects unit based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller.

Features:
- 4 effects patches (reverb, delay, delay/reverb, chorus) selected using 2 high/low toggle switches
- each patch has four parameters which can be controlled using rotary potentiometers
- two CV inputs are available and they override one of the control parameters when in use
